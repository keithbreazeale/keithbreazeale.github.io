# Professional Self-Assessment
I started the Computer Science program at SNHU in January 2019. I joined this program for I already had my Associates in Computer Engineering and my Associates in Electrical Engineering and felt that I had reached a ceiling professionally. I have a family and didn't want to be too late in life and wonder if I could have given them a better life if I had progressed my education. During my tenure in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I've honed my professional aspirations and principles. This experience has readied me to be a valuable addition to future employers. This ePortfolio serves as a testament to my adeptness in devising and crafting industry-grade code and software applications. While it doesn't encompass the entirety of my achievements in this program, it showcases my expertise across three pivotal domains: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

During my tenure in the Computer Science Program, I've enhanced an array of abilities, skills, and knowledge. Elevating my attention to detail and cultivating a security-centric mindset has been pivotal for a future role as a software engineer. Embracing an organized approach, breaking down code into manageable blocks, and integrating testing into my workflow have significantly refined these capabilities. Testing stands as a cornerstone in guaranteeing program functionality and resilience, especially as projects become more intricate. Embracing a tester and security-oriented mindset continuously enhances these indispensable skills and abilities. Paying attention to detail encompasses code reviews, adherence to security standards, and embracing best practices. Prioritizing security throughout the coding process, rather than as an afterthought, fosters a zero-trust ethic, significantly enhancing my coding proficiency. Integrating code reviews with a security-conscious mindset allows me to scrutinize both my code and my peers', identifying potential errors and vulnerabilities that might have eluded notice during initial development. Adhering to best practices ensures the creation of well-structured, comprehensible, and maintainable software code and systems. Seeking input from peers for review not only bolsters my attention to detail and communication skills but also provides a fresh perspective that swiftly unveils overlooked mistakes in my work.

The first application is the "Grazioso Salvare Animal Finder Application" and it displays my knowledge of Software Design and Engineering along with a knowledge of Databases as well. The application in short consists of a Python front-end with dashboard functionality and utilizes MongoDB for it's database. While I was successful at getting this application ported over to Windows from Linux, I was also able to improve the security posture of the application. I have included the original code along with the enhancement code within this ePortfolio.

The second application is the "Binary Search Tree Application" and it displays my knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structures. This application is written C++ and showcases my understanding of the Binary Search Tree algorithm to quickly sort through bid information for an auction. I have included the original code along with the enhancement code within this ePortfolio.

I've gained expertise in these areas, along with various other crucial subjects, such as effective teamwork, stakeholder communication, and the validation of systems. Throughout my Computer Science program, I engaged in many collaborative projects, notably in CS-310, Team Collaboration and Project. This course involved multiple team-based tasks, like managing changelogs and conducting code reviews. Moreover, I've actively communicated with stakeholders across several classes to ensure well-rounded product outcomes. My involvement in the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course further enriched my understanding of diverse roles within team-based software environments, encompassing QA, product ownership, project management, development, and more. Lastly, in the IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis and Design course I was able to learn about the usage of the unified modeling language (UML) and, through the vehicle of a student group project, apply these elements to the system development life cycle.

Overall, my top seven skills that I have acquired from the Computer Science program at SNHU are (in no particular order): 
1. Software Development: Proficiency in the software development lifecycle, including designing, coding, testing, debugging, and maintaining software systems.
2. Problem-Solving Skills: The capability to identify and tackle complex problems by breaking them down into manageable components, using logical and analytical thinking.
3. Understanding of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems: Knowledge about hardware-software interaction, memory management, processors, and operating system functionalities.
4. Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Knowledge of security principles and practices to protect systems, data, and networks from vulnerabilities and cyber threats.
5. Software Testing and Debugging: Skills in testing methodologies, including unit testing, integration testing, and debugging techniques to ensure software reliability and functionality.
6. Team Collaboration
7. Attention to Detail

Course Outcome 1: I Employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by the completion of the first application which was for Software Design and Engineering / Database categories. I was able to port this application over successfully to be used in Windows as opposed to just Linux. This will allow for a higher adoption rate of the dashboard to be used across multiple environments.

Course Outcome 2: I Designed, Developed, and Delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by the completion of both applications which was for Software Design and Engineering / Database as well as the Algorithms and Data Structures categories. First, I created Code Reviews for both applications (seen in the Code Reviews section) which I walked through the code in a recorded session identifying areas of opportunity on the existing code before beginning my enhancements. Additionally, for the Software Design and Engineering / Database categories, I updated the existing Read-Me file that guides the installer/developer through the process of getting the application up and running.

Course Outcome 3: I Designed and Evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by the completion of the second application which was for the Algorithms and Data Structures Application. I was able to enhance the existing code to work with new algorithms for the displaying of bids by ID, Amount, searching for bids by ID, and searching for bids by amount within a specified range. While the amount of code nearly doubled in size because of the enhancements mentioned, no impact or lag was noticed when testing the new enhancements. This leads to no real performance impact to the user.

Course Outcome 4: I Demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by the completion of the first application which was for the Software Design and Engineering / Database categories. I was able to combine the usage of Python and MongoDB to provide a dashboard that can be used for checking an inventory of animals based on certain rescue types. This adds value to certain organizations that specialize in providing the right type of animal training to a specific situation.

Course Outcome 5: I Developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by the completion of the first application which was for the Software Design and Engineering / Database categories. I was able to update the dashboard’s usage of Python and MongoDB to significantly later versions which resolved a number of security vulnerabilities. This type of enhancement is operating system agnostic, meaning that regardless of whether it is on Linux or Windows, newer versions of Python and MongoDB can be used. Lastly, to harden to dashboard’s database further, I was able to provide instruction on changing the default port number so that if there was a port sniffing attack on common ports, that the database would not be discovered.

# Code Reviews
A code review is a critical quality assurance process wherein the source code and its output undergo thorough examination. This practice holds immense significance for computer science practitioners as it guarantees a certain level of uniformity in project development and facilitates the adherence to elevated coding standards, thus contributing significantly to professional success. Below are the code reviews that I have completed based on specific categories.

## Software Design and Engineering and Database Category
The artifact that I am choosing for both the Software Engineering/Design and Database categories is the “Grazioso Salvare Animal Finder Application." This application has a Python front end and utilizes MongoDB (NoSQL) for it’s database. This artifact was developed in the CS 340: Client/Server Development course at SNHU. 
I was tasked with creating a web application that interfaces with existing animal shelter databases. The goal is to identify and categorize dogs suitable for various rescue scenarios like water rescue, mountain/wilderness rescue, disaster recovery, and scent tracking for specific individuals. This application streamlines interaction with individual dog profiles sourced from a MongoDB database.
The user interface will be a user-friendly and intuitive dashboard accessible to clients. This approach leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern, providing a structured and organized framework. Additionally, the application will incorporate a RESTful protocol, extending the capabilities of the HTTP protocol to offer an application programming interface (API) for seamless communication between components. This combination of technologies aims to enhance usability, minimize errors, and optimize training time.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
The artifact that I am choosing for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is the "Binary Search Tree Algorithm." This artifact is a data structure capable of storing bid information and enabling rapid retrieval of a specific ID number using a binary search tree algorithm. This artifact was developed in the CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms course at SNHU.
This code defines a binary search tree class (BinarySearchTree) and its associated methods to manage a collection of bids. It also includes utility functions for loading data from a CSV file, converting strings to doubles, and displaying bid information. The program uses a simple command-line interface to interact with the binary search tree.

# Software Design and Engineering / Database Application
As mentioned in the Software Engineering Design and Database Category Code Review, the application that was chosen was the "Grazioso Salvare Animal Finder" Application. This application has a Python front end and utilizes MongoDB (NoSQL) for it’s database. This artifact was conceptualized, designed, and built as part of the CS 340 Client/Server Development course at SNHU in April 2023. The objective of the web application is to create a user-friendly interface that interfaces with an existing animal shelter database. Its purpose is to identify and categorize dogs available for various rescue training programs.  Developed using Python and the Dash framework, the application integrates with MongoDB, a non-relational database, using the PyMongo driver. It's designed to operate within Jupyter Notebook for testing and through a computer terminal with an internet browser. The app's functionalities include importing a CSV file of shelter dogs into MongoDB, incorporating necessary dependencies such as Python libraries, PyMongo, and the Dash framework. It also includes a Python source code and CRUD module to manipulate the imported data within MongoDB.

This artifact constitutes a multi-tier application employing the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture and RESTful protocol design, extending the HTTP protocol to offer an API. The MVC pattern emphasizes a clear separation of concerns: the model handles data management, the view determines the user interface using the Dash framework, and the controller retrieves and modifies data via the PyMongo driver. 
Each record in the MongoDB database is a BSON document, retrieved in a JSON format by the web app. This dashboard mirrors the following screen:

</div>

I selected this application for it was one that I was proud of doing while in the CS 340 course. I saw it as a challenge since it was originally created in Linux on SNHU’s Apporto platform which was no longer available to me, so I decided to see if I could get it up and running on the Windows platform. In doing this, it allowed me to showcase my ability to work with Python and MongoDB in a different platform, which enables a greater audience to use the application which is an improvement on it’s own.

The focus of the artifact enhancements was on transitioning the web application from the Apporto Virtual Lab, a Linux-based remote desktop platform, to a Windows environment. Following the initial development in the Apporto Virtual Lab, I meticulously redesigned the software to cater to user requirements within a structured framework. Relying on the provided documentation as a guide, I meticulously replicated the web application environment in a Windows terminal, continuously updating and refining the documentation to reflect the steps taken in this recreation process. There was also some issues with the geolocational chart rendering that I was able to resolve. The full listing of the enhancements are:

1.  Upgraded Python from 2.7 to 3.7 and MongoDB from 5.0 to 7.0, reducing security vulnerabilities if the application/database were to be attacked.
2.	Enhanced Comments for the developers to understand at a glance what each block is doing.
3.	Reduced Logo size by half, allowing the user experience to be less cluttered.
4.	Updated deprecated python components in the code, which reduces security vulnerabilities if the application/database were to be attacked. 
5.	Enhancement for when a row is selected, the entire row is highlighted, instead of just a cell.
6.	Minor enhancement to Pie Chart to have a better title to provide a more meaningful data view.
7.	Major overhaul on the Geolocation Chart where it wasn’t plotting a marker after the filtered data table was generated.
8.	Updated Read-Me file to include Windows installation instructions.
9.	Enhanced security of application by changing the default port number of 43981, which reduces outside port sniffing attacks on default ports.


The setup and execution of the web application posed considerable challenges. However, this experience showcased my proficiency in employing well-established and inventive techniques, tools, and skills within computing practices. Before delving into the web application documentation, I adeptly navigated the setup procedures for Python and MongoDB. Furthermore, adapting the web app's source code functionality to accommodate changes in the PyMongo driver version and an upgraded MongoDB platform underscored my ability to implement computer solutions that not only deliver value but also align with industry-specific objectives. The biggest challenge ultimately was porting the application over from Linux to Windows. This was due to the older versions of Python and MongoDB that were used.

# Algorithms and Data Structures Application
As mentioned in the Algorithms and Data Structures Code review, the application that was chosen was the "Binary Search Tree" Application. This application is written in C++. This artifact was conceptualized, designed, and built as part of the CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms course at SNHU in December 2021. The objective of this application was to create a small, efficient program for loading bid information (stored in a CSV file) and then allowing the user to search through the bids via a terminal. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

I selected this application for it was coded in my second best programming language, C++. I saw this as a challenge, since I don’t currently have a career as a developer. By working on this application, it allowed me to showcase my ability to work with another programming language that wasn’t Python, which of the two programming languages C++ executes faster than Python , making it great for embedded or enterprise applications. 

The focus of the artifact enhancements was to enable the ability to list all bids by dollar amount as well as the ability to find all bids by a dollar amount within a specific range. While making the enhancements, I was able to put my developer hat on and look at things from that perspective which allowed me to improve the structure of the code not only from something as simple as comments but to the overall functionality of the application. I also was able to put my end user hat on, to review the existing code and confirm if there was anything that didn’t work as intended.  The full listing of enhancements are:

1.	Enhancement to the existing program to enable the ability to list all bids by dollar amount.
2.	Enhancement to the existing program to enable the ability to find all bids by dollar amount within a specified range. (Currently hard-coded, future enhancement would be to allow user input to specify these ranges.)
3.	As identified in the code review, added better comments where necessary for other developers to understand what each code block does.

When I was originally creating this application, my understanding of C++ was limited. The way the course was taught and the base code that was provided throughout was incredibly helpful. While making the enhancements, I was able to put my developer hat on and look at things from that perspective which allowed me to improve the structure of the code not only from something as simple as comments but to the overall functionality of the application. I also was able to put my end user hat on, to review the existing code and confirm if there was anything that didn’t work as intended. The main challenges that were faced ultimately was the learning curve of C++. In my previous Milestone for the Software Engineering/Design category, Python to me, is significantly easier to pick up as a non-developer than C++.
