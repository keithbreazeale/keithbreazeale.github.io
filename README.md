# Welcome
This ePortfolio serves as a comprehensive amalgamation of the knowledge and proficiencies cultivated during my tenure in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It encapsulates my progressive journey within the program, showcasing achievements that have earned me prestigious accolades for exceptional outcomes. Meticulously crafted, this ePortfolio is a testament to my professional growth, manifesting in eloquent written content and visually compelling communication. Its seamless cohesion, technical prowess, and tailored approach aptly cater to specific technical audiences and contexts, exemplifying my competencies and adaptability.
# Code Reviews
Below are the code reviews that I have completed based on specific categories.
## Software Engineering Design and Database Category
The artifact that I am choosing for both the Software Engineering/Design and Database categories is the “Grazioso Salvare Animal Finder Application. This application has a python front end and utilizes MongoDB (NoSQL) for it’s database. This artifact was developed in the CS 340: Client/Server Development course at SNHU. 
I was tasked with creating a web application that interfaces with existing animal shelter databases. The goal is to identify and categorize dogs suitable for various rescue scenarios like water rescue, mountain/wilderness rescue, disaster recovery, and scent tracking for specific individuals. This application streamlines interaction with individual dog profiles sourced from a MongoDB database.
The user interface will be a user-friendly and intuitive dashboard accessible to clients. This approach leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern, providing a structured and organized framework. Additionally, the application will incorporate a RESTful protocol, extending the capabilities of the HTTP protocol to offer an application programming interface (API) for seamless communication between components. This combination of technologies aims to enhance usability, minimize errors, and optimize training time.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
The artifact that I am choosing for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is the  Binary Search Tree Algorithm. This artifact is a data structure capable of storing bid information and enabling rapid retrieval of a specific ID number using a binary search tree algorithm. This artifact was developed in the CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms course.
This code defines a binary search tree class (BinarySearchTree) and its associated methods to manage a collection of bids. It also includes utility functions for loading data from a CSV file, converting strings to doubles, and displaying bid information. The program uses a simple command-line interface to interact with the binary search tree.
